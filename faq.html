<h2>is this some kind of acronym?</h2>
<p>yes, <b>P</b>ythagoras <b>I</b>s <b>D</b>ividing the <b>OR</b>bit. we love math and we love space so we thought "why
    not?".</p>
<h2>what even is this?</h2>
<p>this is a server for our collective projects (or pet-projects) and our pages. you can check them out back at the
    index page, all links are there. when the project is not there yet it leads you to a rickroll so be careful about
    that.</p>
<h2>can i see the source code for the projects?</h2>
<p>most of them are on our <a href="https://github.com/thisislinuxmasterrace">github</a>.</p>
<h2>can i have this domain?</h2>
<p>email us at <a href="mailto:archhaze24@gmail.com">archhaze24@gmail.com</a> and we'll sort it out.</p>
